# truerng

This project is a c# .net wrapper for the c++ code.  It will allow .Net developers to use the USB RNG http://ubld.it/products/truerng-hardware-random-number-generator/

1.  Install the drivers
2.  Check the comm port (In Windows Device manager)
3.  Set the port in the code
4.  Run the app.

Notes:  I have only tested with version 2 of the hardware.
